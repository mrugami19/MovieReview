first of all	-0.81	232	99
was a great	0.81	51	124
from outer space	-0.81	51	13
much better than	0.81	65	95
definitely worth a	0.81	1	32
is not enough	-0.81	97	27
a must for	0.81	5	32
in a way	0.81	88	190
to make up	-0.81	59	16
a world of	0.80	13	45
my only complaint	0.80	2	32
the world of	0.80	66	134
is a total	-0.80	64	15
film is pretty	-0.80	22	11
little to do	-0.79	42	14
will enjoy this	0.79	13	46
for the actors	-0.79	42	3
how bad it	-0.79	86	6
is a rare	0.79	6	35
science theater 3000	-0.79	37	3
is a big	-0.79	57	24
is an entertaining	0.78	3	39
make a movie	-0.78	149	35
go see it	0.77	13	45
just was not	-0.77	60	4
i like this	0.77	4	36
the power of	0.77	22	77
a great film	0.77	47	178
does not it	-0.77	28	7
as much as	0.77	119	209
but the script	-0.77	51	9
by the numbers	-0.77	36	9
a horrible movie	-0.77	32	3
the events of	0.76	17	37
of the barrel	-0.76	36	3
i can only	-0.76	126	68
be a bit	0.76	23	53
better to do	-0.76	43	7
recommend this film	0.76	66	99
i liked it	0.76	23	70
william h macy	0.76	4	44
worst film i	-0.76	91	1
of the greatest	0.76	42	153
what the hell	-0.76	121	31
making a movie	-0.75	38	12
few years later	0.75	15	36
are a bit	0.75	8	48
are much better	-0.75	25	3
not enough to	-0.75	96	18
bad acting and	-0.75	55	5
what to expect	0.75	23	74
i absolutely loved	0.75	3	36
is even worse	-0.75	49	4
can not act	-0.74	61	5
the problem is	-0.74	122	42
not even the	-0.74	70	10
blew me away	0.74	2	29
the impression that	-0.74	75	34
from the usual	0.74	4	25
a group of	-0.74	244	155
an excellent movie	0.74	1	39
adds to the	0.74	19	90
have been made	-0.74	85	36
an excellent job	0.74	4	57
going for it	-0.74	89	19
is nothing more	-0.74	76	11
be the best	0.74	20	61
way too long	-0.74	38	5
they had a	-0.73	43	18
a very good	0.73	115	253
do not recommend	-0.73	56	8
at all the	-0.73	136	52
i think you	0.73	28	62
of my life	-0.73	169	21
is worth watching	0.73	24	53
was pretty good	0.73	36	40
is what makes	0.73	15	66
worst of all	-0.73	59	8
some sort of	-0.73	194	70
avoid at all	-0.72	63	1
on the edge	0.72	24	83
at least the	-0.72	99	41
a great performance	0.72	10	64
well worth the	0.72	3	43
i believe it	0.72	12	45
makes no sense	-0.72	84	17
is about as	-0.72	86	23
the same movie	-0.72	27	11
excellent as the	0.72	0	37
it is got	0.71	37	61
more like a	-0.71	125	55
be the worst	-0.71	81	5
there are too	-0.71	39	15
can not even	-0.71	127	31
any of them	-0.71	61	15
watch for the	0.71	10	24
looks like a	-0.71	165	50
it is like	-0.71	198	108
look like a	-0.71	90	37
are supposed to	-0.71	173	36
it because it	-0.71	47	21
this is just	-0.71	136	57
in many ways	0.71	28	95
is beyond me	-0.71	86	20
a collection of	-0.71	41	18
attempt at a	-0.71	53	9
what a waste	-0.71	65	4
is excellent as	0.70	3	66
it a 2	-0.70	33	0
of this world	0.70	6	27
is perfect as	0.70	1	40
excuse for a	-0.70	97	2
a soap opera	-0.70	31	10
did not enjoy	-0.70	40	10
as well as	0.70	278	659
is just plain	-0.70	99	16
can not save	-0.70	31	2
movie is terrible	-0.70	21	2
suffers from a	-0.70	21	4
was looking forward	-0.70	44	5
well written and	0.70	7	65
unfortunately the film	-0.70	16	3
great as the	0.70	6	48
the lives of	0.69	43	123
is an enjoyable	0.69	1	31
if this is	-0.69	76	36
not one of	-0.69	151	70
what a disappointment	-0.69	27	0
this movie to	0.69	124	147
very well made	0.69	4	32
the worst movies	-0.69	164	2
the acting is	-0.69	665	333
films but this	-0.69	28	6
forced to watch	-0.69	24	3
is a must	0.69	18	180
really bad movie	-0.69	27	0
blah blah blah	-0.69	40	3
and i believe	0.68	9	43
bad acting bad	-0.68	56	4
to save this	-0.68	29	1
on the shelf	-0.68	40	7
know if it	-0.68	26	7
there are many	0.68	80	138
is just not	-0.68	79	29
this film just	-0.68	44	10
is a terrible	-0.68	62	9
very well done	0.67	16	86
to have the	-0.67	54	52
the most annoying	-0.67	37	6
what i like	0.67	2	31
may not be	0.67	46	162
it fails to	-0.67	33	2
the first of	0.67	20	53
i like it	0.67	12	43
the only thing	-0.67	339	141
makes this film	0.67	13	55
and a half	-0.67	183	69
the only real	-0.67	39	19
i liked the	0.67	78	108
a real treat	0.67	0	29
i really enjoyed	0.67	21	93
it is certainly	0.67	31	58
you are really	-0.67	26	7
not get a	0.67	24	41
a major disappointment	-0.66	21	2
how not to	-0.66	54	2
is worse than	-0.66	51	1
the most amazing	0.66	4	35
this movie sucks	-0.66	45	1
is a little	0.66	77	195
the original was	-0.66	32	6
this movie could	-0.66	73	25
great it is	0.66	1	27
loved this movie	0.66	7	84
it is an	0.66	171	302
if you must	-0.66	23	3
not for everyone	0.66	5	42
does not deserve	-0.66	42	6
is hilarious and	0.66	5	19
you will enjoy	0.66	24	85
my money back	-0.66	55	1
makes you think	0.66	11	38
not a big	0.66	32	46
watch it it	0.66	8	28
the very first	0.66	24	49
a great idea	-0.65	41	13
such a bad	-0.65	49	7
released on dvd	0.65	10	36
is bad and	-0.65	30	2
i really liked	0.65	27	86
they could have	-0.65	92	44
far too much	-0.65	25	7

was a good	0.65	65	96
movie is great	0.65	8	38
i thoroughly enjoyed	0.65	4	33
it is laughable	-0.65	15	0
as long as	-0.65	98	71
to be missed	0.65	3	40
is a fine	0.65	20	64
in my mind	0.65	34	62
of the worlds	0.65	15	21
the only saving	-0.65	26	1
mess of a	-0.65	44	6
after watching this	-0.65	69	27
liked the movie	0.65	7	23
what makes the	0.65	5	38
not worthy of	-0.65	20	3
while in the	0.65	8	17
was a very	0.65	51	105
in the woods	-0.65	82	37
out on dvd	0.65	14	46
if i had	-0.65	102	41
of his best	0.65	11	71
making a film	-0.65	30	10
is no longer	0.65	20	32
waste of film	-0.65	35	1

good but the	-0.64	43	19
can not give	-0.64	25	6
does a great	0.64	7	66
sorry for the	-0.64	40	15
a very entertaining	0.64	3	38
are not even	-0.64	54	6
loved this film	0.64	3	31
characters and the	0.64	29	81
in the least	-0.64	40	13
the acting was	-0.64	364	131
it has a	0.64	96	193
twists and turns	0.64	21	82
are just too	0.64	10	17
not a masterpiece	0.64	2	14
is nothing but	-0.64	43	13
trying to be	-0.64	95	24
an interesting idea	-0.64	14	2
attack of the	-0.64	27	6
the use of	0.64	77	126
there was some	-0.64	28	12
lot of things	0.64	11	22

in all a	0.63	32	88
if they are	-0.63	103	52
it wants to	-0.63	39	5
the most overrated	-0.63	12	2
is superb and	0.63	1	29
not much of	-0.63	55	19
fell in love	0.63	13	56
has so much	0.63	6	17
good acting and	0.63	16	23
the reason for	-0.63	40	20
total waste of	-0.63	54	1
bill and ted	0.63	0	18
to laugh at	-0.63	61	15
read the book	-0.63	140	93

was not worth	-0.60	30	1
the producers of	-0.60	38	5
really liked this	0.60	4	33
in the whole	-0.60	72	24
how bad the	-0.60	37	2
able to see	0.60	11	41
and so i	-0.60	19	9
is a poor	-0.60	34	7
and you are	-0.60	67	41
and bad acting	-0.60	18	2
most of us	0.60	21	50
it is amazing	0.60	31	51
this movie will	0.60	52	80
is also a	0.60	109	241
that i know	0.60	11	31
lots of fun	0.60	3	20
to make a	-0.60	430	202
excellent and the	0.60	2	27
perfect and the	0.60	1	17
i love it	0.60	13	53
meant to be	-0.60	149	100
as a child	0.60	42	88
the whole movie	-0.60	227	100
cast is excellent	0.60	0	31
if they were	-0.60	89	26
no reason to	-0.60	55	14
at his best	0.60	15	44
are not funny	-0.60	35	1
seems to be	-0.60	393	265
why oh why	-0.59	23	3
shines in this	0.59	2	13
and i loved	0.59	10	55
at least it	-0.59	72	30
a huge disappointment	-0.59	25	4
to believe the	-0.59	22	9
a feel good	0.59	7	37
i was surprised	0.59	40	72
fast paced and	0.59	4	23
makes you feel	0.59	9	32
can not believe	-0.59	209	70
not too bad	-0.59	57	17
the best one	0.59	10	32
it was great	0.59	12	51
instead it is	-0.59	43	13
a part of	0.59	53	93
could have been	-0.59	541	288
a movie you	0.59	17	44
to see and	0.59	17	35
should have known	-0.59	29	2
is more than	0.59	35	78
is not very	-0.59	104	60
a bad name	-0.59	21	0
watch it again	0.59	36	92
wish to see	-0.59	13	4
it made the	0.59	6	18
more than the	0.59	35	53
is awful the	-0.59	37	0
was a wonderful	0.59	2	32
far the worst	-0.59	45	0
the worst i	-0.58	77	4
is still a	0.58	45	140
a very funny	0.58	14	47
bad and the	-0.58	46	10
a whole new	0.58	16	45
worse than the	-0.58	53	5
say that the	-0.58	83	62
being able to	0.58	42	65
out if you	0.58	13	34
not save the	-0.58	20	1
be forced to	-0.58	29	6
won't be disappointed	0.58	9	39
is about it	-0.58	65	12
performance as the	0.58	25	71
who made this	-0.58	37	7
on the cover	-0.58	46	10
movie although i	0.58	2	12
the appearance of	-0.58	27	16
probably the best	0.58	26	57
a and new	-0.58	18	5
has taken the	0.58	2	10
still talking about	-0.58	3	3
it was first	0.58	11	38
the film with	0.58	37	65
how good it	0.58	3	19
that will make	0.58	11	31
the result is	-0.58	64	48
awful it is	-0.58	22	2
enjoyed this film	0.58	12	48
more movies like	0.58	2	20
really really bad	-0.58	39	4
do not give	-0.58	36	13
does not mean	-0.58	84	50
wrote and directed	-0.58	17	8
does not like	0.58	18	42
is a masterpiece	0.58	10	47
this thing is	-0.58	31	2
seeing this movie	-0.58	73	32
the bad acting	-0.58	42	4
perfect as the	0.58	0	33
so bad that	-0.58	148	14
not bother with	-0.58	40	1
to see some	-0.58	47	24
i would definitely	0.58	2	31
black and white	0.57	96	203
the movie however	0.57	10	19
this made for	-0.57	20	11
is not perfect	0.57	3	35
a great time	0.57	7	33
are some great	0.57	6	23
is just a	-0.57	266	141
not think of	0.57	45	47
movie as i	-0.57	19	7
and then i	0.57	11	20
but in this	-0.57	79	35
mind numbingly awful	-0.57	7	1
not to like	0.57	4	26
one of their	0.57	29	50
is just bad	-0.57	50	2
the second part	0.57	14	31
if only to	-0.57	13	3
many years ago	0.57	9	33
to new york	0.57	17	44
of the israeli	-0.57	5	1
a must watch	0.57	2	24
it takes a	0.57	25	44
and plenty of	0.57	12	31
you will laugh	0.57	15	29
is a true	0.57	19	78
thing about this	-0.57	123	50
is real and	0.57	1	22
this film i	-0.57	232	152
very real and	0.57	1	18
for anyone who	0.57	20	71
glued to the	0.57	5	20
no more than	-0.57	40	22
film one of	0.57	10	26
to think that	-0.57	74	43
was a bit	0.57	71	99
and in my	0.57	6	35
money on this	-0.57	70	0
just is not	-0.57	78	22
the chemistry between	0.57	14	60
and watch it	0.57	29	56
and found it	0.57	7	29
hard to be	-0.57	62	10
good movie if	-0.57	12	4
at all i	-0.57	76	19
in the theater	-0.57	85	56
of people who	-0.57	48	30
back in the	0.57	75	136
the very worst	-0.56	26	0
it deals with	0.56	9	32
a horror movie	-0.56	118	36
the mst3k version	-0.56	21	0
an example of	-0.56	62	32
not afraid to	0.56	9	37
of the famous	0.56	3	20
is not scary	-0.56	41	6
take it in	0.56	0	6
other side of	0.56	12	32
the only problem	0.56	16	29
make a film	-0.56	60	18
appeared to be	-0.56	30	11
the way i	0.56	31	46
this one was	-0.56	85	36
i fell asleep	-0.56	27	1
we would have	0.56	10	15
a less than	-0.56	18	9
as a film	-0.56	43	39
this movie sucked	-0.56	21	1
film is so	-0.56	77	25
do i have	-0.56	10	2
minutes into the	-0.56	63	10
but does not	-0.56	59	38
film is just	-0.56	46	22
for no reason	-0.56	67	12
nothing new to	-0.56	24	0
a very poor	-0.56	30	6
though it was	0.56	32	44
is really just	-0.56	26	12
a total waste	-0.56	49	1
shame on you	-0.56	25	2
not being a	0.56	5	17
there is something	0.56	66	95
sci fi channel	-0.56	48	9
a first rate	0.56	2	22
the man in	0.56	10	40
in what must	0.56	0	6
was pretty much	-0.56	24	7
also very good	0.56	1	41
it a 10	0.56	7	27
film is awful	-0.56	18	1
he is one	-0.56	32	34
who plays the	0.56	36	48
why would a	-0.56	16	1
scene where a	-0.55	36	11
all time the	0.55	9	31
definitely worth seeing	0.55	0	24
it a 3	-0.55	19	0
there are the	-0.55	35	18
a nice little	0.55	6	17
does not matter	0.55	35	57
is a highly	0.55	2	25
was the first	0.55	42	103
is no plot	-0.55	47	2
father in law	0.55	2	19
bad this movie	-0.55	45	4
is a solid	0.55	1	22
the first season	0.55	13	38
of the year	0.55	38	82
is an absolute	0.55	19	34
what makes this	0.55	16	79
90 minutes of	-0.55	46	3
to buy it	0.55	11	22
of view but	-0.55	9	1
the way it	0.55	67	113
life and death	0.55	7	33
why do they	-0.55	31	6
a lot to	0.55	55	81
a pretty good	0.55	54	100
was a major	-0.55	28	15
only saving grace	-0.55	32	1
to be on	-0.55	51	22
not seem to	-0.55	210	115
not miss this	0.55	2	42
looking for something	0.55	24	26
on this show	-0.55	25	10
scenes in the	0.55	51	64
acting was great	0.55	5	15
it on dvd	0.55	20	59
acting is superb	0.55	3	25
do not go	-0.55	72	36
enjoy this film	0.55	15	36
i realize that	-0.55	28	10
with english subtitles	0.55	1	23
in the extreme	-0.55	22	7
unfortunately this is	-0.55	21	1
in the top	0.55	8	22
role as the	0.55	23	54
who lives in	-0.55	23	30
what was with	-0.54	26	0
a better script	-0.54	23	1
best things in	-0.54	4	4
revolt of the	-0.54	18	0
in the army	-0.54	18	7
the same thing	-0.54	65	29
of a movie	-0.54	157	75
but who cares	0.54	11	23
if it were	-0.54	108	54
of the scariest	0.54	0	19
like the other	0.54	9	14
i could not	-0.54	451	226
so the movie	-0.54	29	5
at least has	-0.54	10	2
lady from shanghai	0.54	0	17
is a gem	0.54	1	26
what was the	-0.54	74	10
between the two	0.54	63	126
downhill from there	-0.54	25	1
bad it was	-0.54	74	10
very entertaining and	0.54	3	28
a car accident	-0.54	23	6
worst i have	-0.54	71	3
unless you want	-0.54	35	2
daniel day lewis	0.54	5	29
on earth and	-0.54	14	3
is the greatest	0.54	7	22
is a surprisingly	0.54	2	13
growing up in	0.54	8	38
me to the	-0.54	24	10
of the new	0.54	29	58
not think they	0.54	10	11
of the young	0.54	12	50
was the worst	-0.54	87	5
the most disappointing	-0.54	20	2
watching paint dry	-0.54	31	1
things in the	-0.54	13	15
been a great	-0.54	31	12
not supposed to	0.54	35	34
even close to	-0.54	39	7
is a lousy	-0.54	13	0
the first time	0.54	181	380
stay away from	-0.54	68	16
go for it	-0.54	19	5
the show was	0.54	22	48
was so good	0.54	8	15
is all about	0.54	48	93
it over and	0.54	13	30
it is boring	-0.54	31	3
to recommend it	-0.54	32	10
than the movie	-0.54	26	12
i got to	0.54	20	43
does not understand	0.54	7	19
on this one	-0.54	90	32
for what it	0.54	48	103
a bad movie	-0.54	154	35
of the finest	0.53	13	74
comes across as	-0.53	68	41
is great and	0.53	12	53
the cover of	-0.53	28	5
how bad this	-0.53	70	1
of the novel	-0.53	34	28
probably the worst	-0.53	44	3
the only way	-0.53	74	43
an attempt at	-0.53	28	4
that is pretty	-0.53	38	11
it is too	-0.53	120	81
really did not	-0.53	74	33
too hard to	-0.53	58	14
i just did	-0.53	39	7
better than i	0.53	10	32
of this genre	0.53	12	26
loved it and	0.53	0	36
the final scene	0.53	36	59
is excellent and	0.53	3	53
is excellent the	0.53	3	22
and even then	-0.53	32	11
movie can be	-0.53	27	12
it is kinda	0.53	4	15
not live up	-0.53	27	9
it is definitely	0.53	42	109
not make me	-0.53	25	7
this is a	0.53	789	1405
they would not	-0.53	38	11
the problem with	-0.53	62	25
the movie and	0.53	214	215
sense at all	-0.53	58	5
is first rate	0.53	1	19
and is a	0.53	24	77
example of how	-0.53	49	27
is exactly what	0.53	21	48
go to the	0.53	87	96
it a 9	0.53	0	17
dealing with the	0.53	11	42
is an awful	-0.53	22	5
a cult movie	-0.53	9	1
of the sun	0.53	6	7
tried to be	-0.53	31	3
hours of my	-0.53	45	0
was so disappointed	-0.53	16	1
the combination of	0.53	12	25
a smile on	0.53	3	30
the main problem	-0.53	49	11
the story just	-0.53	20	4
he begins to	0.53	8	31
of the border	-0.53	6	3
to come out	0.53	25	62
nothing in this	-0.53	30	5
oh and the	-0.53	38	10
is a cute	0.53	5	15
to all the	0.53	32	56
over the years	0.53	42	100
just as good	0.53	5	32
do not help	-0.53	24	1
i strongly recommend	0.53	12	31
is not to	0.53	44	78
is really a	-0.53	54	40
have to see	0.53	49	77
should be ashamed	-0.52	53	3
what kind of	-0.52	69	32
although the film	0.52	12	30
i only wish	0.52	9	30
when i was	0.52	124	278
save your time	-0.52	27	2
at its worst	-0.52	9	1
i am not	-0.52	745	459
not just for	0.52	5	28
have seen better	-0.52	37	3
the set up	-0.52	27	6
life in the	0.52	28	66
minutes or so	-0.52	54	19
not see this	-0.52	63	12
is a natural	0.52	3	18
the x files	0.52	12	21
script is so	-0.52	27	4
of love and	0.52	6	41
well worth your	0.52	0	17
complete waste of	-0.52	64	2
get the idea	-0.52	29	9
time and money	-0.52	85	7
only reason to	-0.52	28	4
of these two	0.52	20	34
is simply not	-0.52	27	7
there was no	-0.52	197	62
and what was	-0.52	43	10
is a horrible	-0.52	28	3
than this film	-0.52	18	5
appears to be	-0.52	102	89
the movie from	-0.52	30	13
at the time	0.52	201	361
is not really	-0.52	125	100
should have been	-0.52	263	146
love to see	0.52	13	60
test of time	0.52	4	36
steals every scene	0.52	0	13
the biggest problem	-0.52	36	10
acting by all	0.52	3	16
acting is poor	-0.52	25	1
not give a	-0.52	36	9
but this was	-0.52	104	45
i was pleasantly	0.52	8	48
is beautiful and	0.52	10	36
for me i	-0.52	63	39
the story of	0.52	147	372
me a eak	-0.52	31	2
is terrible and	-0.52	29	2
gave it an	0.52	4	14
no character development	-0.52	35	2
we see the	0.52	36	71
not much better	-0.52	30	2
only good thing	-0.52	74	2
highly recommended to	0.52	2	21
not the best	0.52	38	93
where to begin	-0.52	43	3
do not watch	-0.52	224	66
otherwise it is	-0.52	21	7
the first to	-0.52	25	20
to like this	-0.52	66	17
movie was excellent	0.52	0	14
was terrible the	-0.52	22	1
a wonderful movie	0.52	1	37
was great the	0.52	9	19
film is not	-0.52	137	122
this film by	0.51	12	18
good about this	-0.51	31	1
story is so	-0.51	23	12
sounds like a	-0.51	52	22
not think so	-0.51	51	18
looks good but	-0.51	10	1
it was terrible	-0.51	23	1
the original movie	-0.51	48	17
biggest problem with	-0.51	20	2
that makes this	0.51	16	45
portrayal of a	0.51	8	43
i loved the	0.51	52	116
i hope to	0.51	9	33
impressed with the	0.51	15	39
to root for	-0.51	21	8
it could not	-0.51	43	14
is the reason	0.51	20	19
not good but	-0.51	12	1
to all of	0.51	11	37
or is it	-0.51	36	16
and if you	0.51	115	151
not take it	-0.51	25	12
and yes the	0.51	6	15
sit through this	-0.51	59	4
acting is great	0.51	4	30
did not even	-0.51	149	54
of the night	-0.51	39	30
film well worth	0.51	0	13
the only positive	-0.51	28	0
looks like it	-0.51	80	15
jean claude van	-0.51	19	1
so bad it	-0.51	171	18
a 1 because	-0.51	17	0
was the best	0.51	50	76
and thought provoking	0.51	6	30
we are given	-0.51	29	17
lost in the	-0.51	40	24
do not believe	-0.51	93	36
to it the	0.51	30	28
movie that is	-0.51	119	76
away it is	0.51	6	12
did not the	-0.51	32	4
joe don baker	-0.51	23	4
and not in	-0.51	53	10
have at least	-0.51	35	8
is not it	-0.51	87	42
i find it	-0.51	64	44
it is crap	-0.51	16	0
rest of this	-0.51	30	0
are too many	-0.51	35	15
