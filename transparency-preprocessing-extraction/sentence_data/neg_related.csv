i had numerous problem with this film
dear god i do not know where to start why this movie sucked too much
i was pretty disappointed
"if you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeball out and flush them down the toilet"
"the music there was was annoying, and boring"
someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film
"ugly then, uglier now"
this film is predictable
"even the supporting male character are all ""bad"""
"trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan"
"no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck, or any different from any of the other"
"this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really, really suck"
goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal
it came to an end without reaching a conclusion
a perfect being makes for dull story telling
"i have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary"
it is not worth a pie that you pay for the ticket
"and, as a result it does not really go anywhere"
everything about this film sucks
i could only get through about 25 min of it
"also, one long section of dialog is in spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the french track)."
"the remaining hour and 45 minute was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting."
the acting is abysmal and completely forced
"but i feel that the problem with the film is that ""mood"" is not enough... and not only that, but that the mood painted here is, to my mind, incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening."
"but all in all, an awkward display of british music circa 1964"
it is like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi film and threw all the part he liked into a blender and came up with this
its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally.
"the quality of demille's direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him"
"those who have not read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge tom robbin fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment"
"oh my, i think this may be the single cheesiest movie i have ever seen"
"i think, though, for the most part, the humor falls a bit flat"
"there is a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful"
"it is a rusty version of the pare not trap and you should avoid it, or at least ensure your tetanus shot are up to date if you do not believe me."
"the story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new zealand/american accent just do not work"
"then i went and saw it, i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie"
this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i have seen timeline
"i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board."
"certainly there is very little logic to this movie, but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flick"
the viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this filmok they had 6 story so it was necessary but why?
do not waste your time on this film!
and the special effect are silly enough to do more damage to that tension.
"this film is hardly good, not great at all."
"but when the so called show starts everything become implausible, cheap and rather silly."
i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw.
the production value on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious.
"overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of image that you would see run under the closing credit of a show, rather than anything worth watching for its own merit."
what a complete piece of trash.
"this movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film."
"incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication."
i was not pleased with this film.
i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping.
"but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica."
"not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual christmas tradition."
do not waste your time.
"admitedly i did not watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me."
do not waste your money on this one.
the plot is completely predictable.
i can not believe blockbuster carries this movie
"although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere, and some okay shot that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs day, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere"
save your money and your time
"literally, everything about it sucks."
"you know you are in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and ""the incubus"" is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motion to pay the bill."
"i felt mandylor and the filmmaker were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails."
i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it.
"some may feel burned by the abrupt finale, but it should still appeal to conspiracy crank."
maybe i am missing something.. i just can not believe a movie like this can beat a classic like hddcs!
"certainly not horrible, but definitely not good"
"overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved."
"and instead of wasting time with larry darrell, spend some time with lawrence durrell."
a mess of a movie.
"the story was pretty awful too, could someone just fall in love with a girl because she is pretty but has the mind of a child?"
"i did not mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous."
the tragic truth is that it is so entirely valueless on every level that one can not help but laugh.
all in all pretty poor.
"well, that made it too much work for most person to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched show of all time."
"i had to laugh at that movie ""roach"" stuart pankin and the party bully were even more ridiculous, view at own risk!"
so why does hollywood keep making junk like this?
i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is.
"there are some element that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed with bad acting, plot hole, deus ex machina thrown in, stupid dialog, weak script, and predictable clichés"
"the film, as a whole, is a bit unfocused and the ending, and much of the third act, is really a big mess."
"so in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purpose."
my word cannot convey how painful it was to watch.
most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea.
i am still trying to figure out if that was the worst dubbing ever
there is not an original moment in this whole movie
please avoid
in contention for worst movie ever
what a bad movie
this movie is a cliché-ridden piece of junk
"my trailing thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and acting then the entirety of this film"
you may want to skip this one
this movie is trash
this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen
i pity the cast
this is a horrible movie
the script and dialogue is laughable
the narration was idiotic
"zero sense of timing, editing"
give it a miss
it is one of his poorest role
there was not a laugh to be had
its awful i can not believe that one of the greatest nonsense in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of million of person
as a stand alone film i found this very boring
this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had
i was so horrified by this movie
the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these thing when the supposed plot was unfolding
what a disappointment
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
seriously crappy movie
there was not even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie
the idea just was not all that original
"this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly, just painfully mediocre"
skip this film if you want to keep your soul
what an appalling piece of rubbish
it was just not my cup of tea
"turgid dialogue, feeble characterization"
i did not laugh not even once
the actor that they had portray ryan phillippe's christian and sarah michelle gellar's kathryn are very poor substitute indeed
this movie was pretty average
i do not know if there is any plot
the comedy is not funny at all
you do realize that you have been watching the exact same show for eight year
"the lack of clarity about the game's rule render it incomprehensible, and eventually wearing"
they get worse every time
too terrible for word
a cheap exploitation film
i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minute of the film
i left neither entertained nor enlightened
i think micheal ironside acting career must be over
i detest such concept because they add to public idiocy
there goes an hour and a half of my life i will never see again
the source of that quote has lost all credibility with me
no reason to bother renting this flick
this movie is just horrible
tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer
too many scene out of context
keep some dignity
the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel
this movie is bad news
priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story
"he is supported by lame actor, cheap special effect and unfunny gags"
the female character was annoying as well
i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie
there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action
the execution and the script is mediocre
"it is so remarkably low-budget, underscripted, underacted, and hit every 70's cliche except disco"
this mini-series is actually more entertaining
one of the five worst movie i have ever watched
we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring
joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson
i also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movie
this movie does not have high and lows
the acting is horrible
its filled with b level tv actor sitting in paneled room with lawn chair trying to act a script that makes almost no sense
it is grotesuque and awful
dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable
"the writing range from mediocre to horrid, however"
it totally sucks
technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one
this film induces shock
not a good film at all
"overall, i definitely did not like this movie"
do not waste your time watching this
"truly terrible, pretentious, endless film"
this movie is so unfunny
entrail of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible
this movie's maker were the real slacker
i found that this movie was terrible
the actor did a really good job playing their role--particularly the mom
"i wont take too much time here, just wanted to state that darkman 3 is awesome"
"it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen king movie ""misery (1990)"""
the dialog are dumb
i strongly suggest that no one see this movie ever
it is that awful
it contains the uprising of the oppressed
bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event
worth seeing only for curiosity sake
"this one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture"
"a strong cast is utterly wasted, scene repeatedly end at the least interesting moment and the script says nothing new"
this was a disappointing film
it is enjoyable and fast-paced
the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tale
the scripting between the creative gore moment is rather unbearable
"this movie is a ""deconstructed thriller"""
i love julian sand and will at least attempt to watch anything he is in
i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist
"do not waste your time or money on this film, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful"
the film itself is clumsy
"caan is miscast, the character are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and there is virtually no establishing detail"
"so... it is really sexist, and classist"
please do not waste +/- 2 hour of your life watching this movie - just do not
it is very hard to enjoy a film where character are screaming at the top of their lung during 80% of the movie for no reason
the music is just awful
i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movie ever made
because this is not a well made film
"basically, the plot line went nowhere"
this was much worse
is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences
i do not understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all i wanted to do was turn it off.
"over-simplified drama verging on soap opera, with a role for maclaine that is by turn overly 'colorful' and embarrassingly sentimental"
there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever made
"i fast forwarded through most of this, and tossed it to one side, ready for the hammer"
"there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story, the closest we get jill and even then the development is spotty at best."
"i do not know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film could not of got any better."
i am so sick of that crap.
"i doubt many person were considering seeing this movie if they had not already, but just in case: do not"
just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right winger at faux network who produced this travesty.
"meh, i am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you are looking for a bad movie to watch with friend, here is what i recommend: watch this movie, then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back."
the story is not interesting and there are segment of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story
in my opinion this movie advances no new thought.
to promote this as a horror film is a joke.
"the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end dashed it."
a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one.
"the acting is criminal, the direction practically non-existent, and the special effect presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulty on a defenceless laptop computer"
it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can not stand.
as a prequel this is fairly lame.
"this film has a weak plot, weak characterization, and really weak special effect that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it."
"many of his notoriously awful production were released by brain damage film, a label to avoid like the plague for the most part."
"not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this tepid affair."
the ending is sappy and implausible.
the character are one dimensional and over used.
this film is mediocre at best.
"absolutely nothing happen in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by amenabar's usual collaborator mateo gil."
may i please have my $13.00 back?
what i mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize.
"the plot makes no sense, and the various character drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all."
"at the moment, a 2.7 rating is on imdb and it does not deserve a that low appreciation."
"well, all in all, i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made."
"my dissatisfaction is split: 30% tone-deafness, 70% lackluster writing.the 30%: i agree with the first commenter's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the character and scope of the story."
"oh and yeah, it just ends very arbitrarily with parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected"
"it was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie."
what a dreadful movie!
"many person see this as a classic, but i obviously must have missed something."
"never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intention and failure"
i totally hated the movie.
the storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better
this is surely one of the worst film ever made and released by a major hollywood studio.
not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person.
"the story was awful, the character were very one dimensional."
it is just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through.
"this must be one of the worst movie i have ever seen, the graphic are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process"
"all in all, this is just terrible."
this is possibly the worst of all the columbo movie.
this movie was like a bad indie with a-list talent.
"i do not think i have seen a movie she starred in that i liked, including this one, where the goody two-shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam."
"this movie that is being commented is not too bad, but as i have seen further on in their movie, their movie stay the same of typical plot and typography."
"waste of film, i gave it a 1/10: awful dud."
"this is so bad, so very very bad."
it only gets worse!
sadly however this film just does not make it on any score.
"it is trash, and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it!"
actor are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time-pass of song.
"and the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins."
do not watch this sad excuse for a film.
"in other word; it is really, really bad!"
"the replication of the disaster is not bad, but the drama around it is at some time silly, badly acted and way-too soap opera-like."
"this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it, there is a sense of deja vu, do not be surprised."
avoid this one at all cost.
"i have waited a long time to see dr tarr's torture dungeon and after i watched it, i was really disappointed by it."
"i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially by so many critic who are, otherwise, quite sensible.there is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.the most easily explained example of this is the director's use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music."
"spillane wrote trash paperback, for sure, but how do you make it worse?"
"well, i will be honest: i never want to see this film again."
usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problem getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with monstroid or monster or whatever it is called... nah
"as noted, it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a tv budget: all soundstage, with minimal set backed by the lighted cycs!"
what horrible writing and acting.
if you are interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that did not quite make the history book by all mean check out tyrannosaurus azteca.
"most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated, much less amusing"
the choice is there is and with regard to this movie its your...not recommended but not entirely bad either.
"until then, there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade."
"this is the worst movie i have seen since ""i know who killed me"" with lindsey lohan."
"without the novel's interior monologue, the celluloid morvern callar is nobody."
"you could probably pass it all off as character developmant, but all of them are either recycled from earlier scene in the movie, or are just simply to flat and uninteresting."
"this rubbish was a great opportunity, lost again."
ignore this if it ever airs on tv.
"and, proudly, they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act."
i rated it a 1/10 because imdb will not allow me to use decimal.
wife swap = average sucking reality show.
"but, one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap."
"as a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-over reading tedious political diatribe at your audience, and then, when you could not think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listener after the first 100 word in any case?"
"unfortunately for ""the wedding date,"" i can only rate the film with 4/10 possible tears"
the current version of jane austen's persuasion shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation.
"saying you ""liked"" this film only encourages filmmaker to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre."
it was not worth the $6.
"at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly ""i can see person sitting at home saying ""this is not amazing, its sh$t"" he is not wrong."
i do not think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak film he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm.
"it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless, but actually physically painful to watch."
"it is not obvious from viewing this film (so i recommend viewer research the person who present their case in it) but this presentation on the reality of islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-muslim is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition."
i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad.
"what a waste, not just for the viewer but for the actor as well."
"if you have read the book, there are zero surprise, no change, no altering of scene or character."
"watchable nonsense, but at the same time extremely forgettable."
i am afraid i do not have the patience to write more.
i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time.
cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor.
"however, if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plot based thereon, if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effect to denote the happening of spirituality, and perhaps even expect reasonable non-wooden dialog an acting, then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie: stay."
but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself
this was so lame that i turned the dvd off...maybe halfway through.
but i saw no happy ending for these two person...and time proved me right.
avoid this movie at all cost.
"still a sucker for pyun's esthetic sense, i liked this movie, though the ""unfinished"" ending was a let-down."
"this movie, i thought it would never end, would have been better if all the character would have been nuked in the first five minute."
"when i saw this ""documentary"", i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again."
"trying too hard to be terrifying, lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes the screaming skull more like a snoring dull."
"undeveloped/unbelievable story line,(by the time i sort of figured out where it was going, i no longer cared) bad casting."
"watch it as a late night movie, mstified, but do not go out of your way."
"it is difficult not to notice the non-sensical script, the unrealistic acting, and the inappropriate musical score."
unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 euro at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie.
"the actor were horrible, i have seen better acting in middle school play."
this film is self indulgent rubbish.
"rating, 3."
there is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest.
almost on a par with the film 'the need' for awful acting.
"generally i like horror movie, but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friend hand."
"otherwise, stay far far far far far away from this one."
this was a complete disappointment.
what a disappointment
"this becomes evident right off the bat, as we are introduced to the would-be killer, and soon realize that the (acting) is the scariest thing happening... after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern time, yet the acting remains the same."
"no vampire, no dancing, no scene of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on god earth i will ever, ever, ever watch this one again"
this film is 75 minute long and feel like three and a half hour.
"the movie sucked, it was not funny, it was not exciting."
"i did not thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movie when i watched the commercial - namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar: the ""heroine"""
thumb down.
"filled to the brim with drug-induced image that reek of the common raving of your average asylum resident, this ""movie"", despite its colorful appearance, is not for human, especially not children"
this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen.
the whole story seemed stupid too.
very boring prequel to the main series.
i would not recommend this film to anyone.
"cheap-looking and ugly, this film did not even seem to entertain the kid in the audience, except for one fairly amusing toilet joke."
was one of the worst time i have spent at the movie.
"if the ranking had a zero, this movie would get it."
we are talking really bad directing
the costume design as you can expect is also excellent i`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaint after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime .
that should sum it all up for you.do not waste your time.
"but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquy (poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them) that it is all too overblown and self-important."
"yes, kazaam is one of those horribly bad movie that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movie, but with humanity"
"i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i am to make any sense out of this.all in all, very disappointed in something i have waited for year to watch."
a bad film.
"even worse, misty's outrage originally concerned the way moltre and zapdo were being held."
"for the sake of your brain-cell count, do not watch this thing!"
"thankfully, the pain ends after an hour and a half."
movie goer - avoid watching this movie.
my wife and i were both bored out of our mind within 10 minute.
this one's got even less empathy going for it.
in the end though like most television movie this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ant.
"do yourself a favour and do not bother with this one, there are much better film out there."
"in fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationship in the film."
all i could think of while watching this movie was b-grade slop.
i would hardly consider this as a quality though
"really bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty awful, overall."
this drummond entry is lacking in continuity.
poorly written trash
the video quality is awful.
i would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre.
there is no logic whatsoever for what is happening.
this movie got extremely silly when thing started to happen.
i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throat of non-tagalog filipino but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie.
"ok, i wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful."
this movie is a horrible distortion of ly and exaggeration that were put together by the most shameless lunatic to ever work on a tv movie.
a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted.
it is realistic but you would not go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie.
do not watch this.
at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am
anyway i am ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made.
"and believe me, i am a guy who enjoys his crappy documentary; this film is not funny, witty, quaint, it is nothing."
"i have not seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent, carrying a gun."
"i rarely write review for imdb.com, but i feel compelled to warn potential viewer that this movie is terrible."
"i wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off."
"holy cow, what a piece of sh*t this movie is."
"it is just goofy and silly and for the location, has nostalgic significance."
"watching the detective (2007)' was a complete waste of time for lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy, bur please do not let it be a waste of your time!rating: 0 out of 100."
"i may have seen worse film than this, but i if i have, i do not remember."
all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say.
by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing.
it is just terrible.
the dialoque did not make sense and i do not think they were very witty
this show is awful.
"""we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly."
"this is pretty much a low-budget, made for tv, type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original."
"i agree with those review i have read here, and i have no word to define such a turkey like this, but despite everything, i still can find a reason for movie like this to exist."
"very much a film from the time -- extremely long sequence with no dialogue, bad flashback, and an almost entirely male cast."
acting is poor.
"writer buck henry (who did not write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumb.two thumb down."
it is not worth the time.
there is really nothing more to it.
it is not a movie worth renting not even for an 80's low-budget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back!
the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.
the worst movie i have seen in quite a while.
"if you like devito, this is another classic devito kind of role - but he is only a supporting actor and there for cliché value."
"there is a pointless confrontation at the end, and believe me i am not spoiling anything for you - there is not enough plot to spoil.i figure the whole thing was a tax write-off or a rush job to make use of unused budget money left over from some better movie."
"what is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version i saw was an nth-generation copy, with poor colmy - which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused."
"completely ridiculous ""period"" film is only a thin excuse for its extensive, graphic depiction of the heroine's affair with ""the beast"", a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some woman."
most of acting is amateurish.
the plot had no sense.
this really is the worst film i have ever seen.
this film may have been the biggest let-down i have experienced in renting movie based on imdb review.
"how this film could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspect of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable."
i can only shrug.
this is the most boring worthless piece of crap i have ever wasted an hour of my life on.
"this movie was on t.v the other day, and i did not enjoy it at all."
"judging it on it is own, it was pretty boring"
i am warning you to please do not waste your time/money with this movie.
"everyone associated with this, must have shuddered whenever it was shown."
"direction, script, and editing is pretty lousy."
"this movie was not absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad."
i could not wait for it to be over.
do not take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie.
i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague.
a lot of bad acting or wrong role for actor.
"and of course two of the worst movie ever made, and i do mean two of the worst movie ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the film, and the show it was based on.power ranger is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising."
"the film made no statement, squandered time, and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment."
the editing and cinematography is...worse.
"bottom-line: this game is a plot-less, no character development mess with a barely dressed unmarysuish(thankfully)young woman in the lead that goes through boring tombs for some boring reason(what that might be i could not tell you)with unimaginative shooting gameplay."
this is one movie it is almost impossible to write a spoiler for....because nothing much happens
their rating are as obvious as the bias in this film.
it certainly falls into line with everything else about the character.
"""promise me this"" has no plot."
this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition.
"what can i say about this film other than ""do not see it""."
this movie was horribly inaccurate.
"there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book, or even borrow it from the library"
no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again.
however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plothole and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thriller that i`ve seen
"this documentary (or i should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the person be, when they have full enthusiasm on something like that."
unusual but not particularly good.
the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it.
this movie is probably the worst i have seen.
the acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when rainbow interact with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scare or suspense to be had.
i would rate this in the top 10 worst movie ever.
causing even more disappointment as although some of these scene are crude they do fill in important gap in the story.
"yeah, it is worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least can try to."
i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent person...until the finale.
"well this is a typical ""straight to the toilet"" slasher film"
is probably the weakest element of this show.
"it is has uncomfortable humour, but is equally frustratingly silly, and over-the-top in its weirdness."
this movie is horrible.
this is a horrible film in every way.
"the music is a total mess (it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser) and as such, it complements the movie perfectly."
"really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful."
"my main sticking point with the mst3k commentary and with most of the reviews i have read on final justice, however, involve the criticism of joe don baker."
"the lighting is horrid, very unpolished, but if it was just that i could overlook it."
this is one of the worst film i have *ever* seen!
"i give this movie an 'a' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower grade for execution"
"the scene where the child throw rock at the bird until it dies, with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other child, made me sick and has haunted me ever since."
"for someone who was disappointed by richard chamberlain's 1985 version, i now highly recommend it if you can not get your hand on the granger version."
"still, i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it is so damn funny."
it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all
"i have not felt this disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documantary, in quite some time"
"this film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy."
it is unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest.
"in the end, it was laughable at best, painful at worst."
"i give it one star for the hippie sex scene and eye candy woman, otherwise forget it."
"its not a very deep or penetrating film, and its definitely a propaganda film, but its also a showcase for lean's editing skill - its all about how the piece are put together."
"but if else, then, avoid at all cost."
too bad i can not give a 0.
"on top of that, this just looks like a bad movie."
the plot is so silly nobody can believe it
i condemn this movie... perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on.
it was the ending that i hated.
"i got to tell you though, the beginning (with the whale noise and nothing much else) is pretty haunting and the end credit (with the most godawful song) is pretty entertaining."
"none of the skit are even remotely funny, or even the least bit clever."
avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical.
if he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movie
this pile of sh!t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made.
the brain had a certain entertainment value for me but i would think most person would dislike it.
it was his worst movie ever.
"it was not his acting though, that was alright, but the script just did not make any sense."
i am glad i watched it on tv for free
this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen.
"boy, was i disappointed."
"i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempt to reclaim the audience, far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie."
"i feel like i have just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing!"
"i was not sure how to rate this movie, since it was so bad it was actually very funny."
usually the film plot and action sequence can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close.
pure exploitation flick.
"the ending really sucked, but even that had some enjoyably trashy element."
a kamal hassan movie being horrible.
the whole 'night of the living dead' sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary.
it is infuriating that movie like this even get made.
"this was just horrible the plot was just ok, but the rest of the was was bad"
guess there was not time to develop any drama.
"this movie was god-awful, from conception to execution."
i was somewhat disappointed with this film.
the story idea is interesting but poorly executed.
otherwise i would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series.
"i am not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decade worth of academy award, i can honestly say that this year's award show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that i have ever had the misfortune to witness."
just plain dreadful and awful.
"this is probably one of the worst movie i have ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent."
its absolute rubbish!
"so now, for the first time, my snipe-method of film recommendation has failed."
the rest of it is unbearable dreck
"i had planned to write something explaining what i did not like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than i thought."
the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me.
here is my revenge: i do notrecommend it.
"come to think of it, i am not sure just who this flick is for -except maybe gay and bi-sexual sandm fan who like poorly scripted, poorly shot indy film about themselves."
i did not even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theater and me and my friend just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min.
well after watching this i can say that it are not the worst movie ever made
even though roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended miya totally eclipsed him.
"this was the most cliché ridden, plot deficient, plot-absurd, just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time"
but it was lame.
i am so not surprised because that is so very predictable.
