18,0,i had numerous problem with this film
72,1,dear god i do not know where to start why this movie sucked too much
111,1,i was pretty disappointed
116,10,"if you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeball out and flush them down the toilet"
205,6,"the music there was was annoying, and boring"
232,0,someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film
246,7,"ugly then, uglier now"
294,0,this film is predictable
306,19,"even the supporting male character are all ""bad"""
357,0,"trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan"
455,12,"no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck, or any different from any of the other"
608,0,"this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really, really suck"
650,2,goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal
769,8,it came to an end without reaching a conclusion
774,3,a perfect being makes for dull story telling
823,0,"i have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary"
945,21,it is not worth a pie that you pay for the ticket
1010,2,"and, as a result it does not really go anywhere"
1024,23,everything about this film sucks
1033,0,i could only get through about 25 min of it
1158,9,"also, one long section of dialog is in spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the french track)."
1243,7,"the remaining hour and 45 minute was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting."
1275,1,the acting is abysmal and completely forced
1282,4,"but i feel that the problem with the film is that ""mood"" is not enough... and not only that, but that the mood painted here is, to my mind, incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening."
1344,4,"but all in all, an awkward display of british music circa 1964"
1396,13,it is like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi film and threw all the part he liked into a blender and came up with this
1411,40,its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally.
1464,3,"the quality of demille's direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him"
1503,5,"those who have not read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge tom robbin fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment"
1583,0,"oh my, i think this may be the single cheesiest movie i have ever seen"
1592,16,"i think, though, for the most part, the humor falls a bit flat"
1596,6,"there is a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful"
1701,10,"it is a rusty version of the pare not trap and you should avoid it, or at least ensure your tetanus shot are up to date if you do not believe me."
1751,8,"the story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new zealand/american accent just do not work"
1778,3,"then i went and saw it, i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie"
1784,4,this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i have seen timeline
1815,1,"i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board."
1830,0,"certainly there is very little logic to this movie, but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flick"
1834,0,the viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this filmok they had 6 story so it was necessary but why?
1841,4,do not waste your time on this film!
1894,2,and the special effect are silly enough to do more damage to that tension.
1906,0,"this film is hardly good, not great at all."
2000,5,"but when the so called show starts everything become implausible, cheap and rather silly."
2012,0,i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw.
2084,3,the production value on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious.
2119,8,"overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of image that you would see run under the closing credit of a show, rather than anything worth watching for its own merit."
2130,0,what a complete piece of trash.
2146,3,"this movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film."
2156,3,"incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication."
2165,1,i was not pleased with this film.
2179,10,i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping.
2223,1,"but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica."
2231,11,"not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual christmas tradition."
2240,5,do not waste your time.
2274,1,"admitedly i did not watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me."
2298,7,do not waste your money on this one.
2357,1,the plot is completely predictable.
2363,0,i can not believe blockbuster carries this movie
2478,0,"although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere, and some okay shot that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs day, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere"
2480,7,save your money and your time
2517,20,"literally, everything about it sucks."
2523,0,"you know you are in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and ""the incubus"" is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motion to pay the bill."
2587,8,"i felt mandylor and the filmmaker were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails."
2689,16,i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it.
2727,9,"some may feel burned by the abrupt finale, but it should still appeal to conspiracy crank."
2859,6,maybe i am missing something.. i just can not believe a movie like this can beat a classic like hddcs!
2895,0,"certainly not horrible, but definitely not good"
2910,11,"overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved."
2933,26,"and instead of wasting time with larry darrell, spend some time with lawrence durrell."
2946,7,a mess of a movie.
2975,2,"the story was pretty awful too, could someone just fall in love with a girl because she is pretty but has the mind of a child?"
3069,16,"i did not mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous."
3075,1,the tragic truth is that it is so entirely valueless on every level that one can not help but laugh.
3116,4,all in all pretty poor.
3128,5,"well, that made it too much work for most person to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched show of all time."
3186,4,"i had to laugh at that movie ""roach"" stuart pankin and the party bully were even more ridiculous, view at own risk!"
3215,7,so why does hollywood keep making junk like this?
3247,0,i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is.
3258,0,"there are some element that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed with bad acting, plot hole, deus ex machina thrown in, stupid dialog, weak script, and predictable clich√©s"
3274,8,"the film, as a whole, is a bit unfocused and the ending, and much of the third act, is really a big mess."
3296,11,"so in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purpose."
3406,4,my word cannot convey how painful it was to watch.
3428,8,most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea.
