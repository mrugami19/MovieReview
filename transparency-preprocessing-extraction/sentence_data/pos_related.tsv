25	5	not perfect by a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
68	7	the whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm.
101	0	even though it has one of the standard "revenge price plot," this film is my favorite of vincent price's work.
117	5	i really enjoyed this movie, it is really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventure, she is just great.
216	10	with more laugh than any other third-in-a-disney-series movie, hakuna matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.
245	0	it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much
270	0	when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thought but i watched it and it was actually funny
315	6	it touched me in a way that, even all these year later, still affects me.
330	2	i strongly recommend seeing for all
397	2	without a doubt, the best late night television ever.
510	0	anyway the story line was although simple, but still very real and touching
673	0	well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fan to get interested in the genre than the later argento entry which go overboard in all directions
731	3	since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this
849	2	my favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again, was the wonderful scene with the physicist playing badmitton, i loved the sweater and the conversation while they waited for robbin to retrieve the birdie.
900	16	but the first five season or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast.
996	10	but who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action-scene are very well done, and you are never bored while watching this movie!
1046	1	i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over.
1061	2	this film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting film in recent times
1071	1	more like spinal tap than anything else, the film is clever from the start
1208	10	much of the film is made up of huge action sequence which are very exciting.
1299	0	a little sappy, but the story is uplifting an fresh.
1327	8	but do not get me wrong, dode' ka-den may not be kurosawa's best, but coming from the greatest director of all time, it is much better than 99% of today's film.
1397	11	overall, this is a pretty good movie
1488	8	the film move at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again, just because it makes you want to do that.
1548	8	the music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it.
1618	0	the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need.
1725	3	if anyone loves the odd couple, you will adore this movie
1740	0	the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scene.
1746	1	one of the greatest movie i have ever - ever seen
1862	13	it is very realistic and well-done, and it is very difficult to watch
1924	3	rent this movie, watch it all and laugh your ass off
1945	5	it has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade
1956	2	this film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy
1975	6	as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different element are balanced inside the frame
1995	0	a french film ester williams would love
2016	20	max steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gesture of the character, placing more emphasis on them
2070	6	although suffering from a hesitant story-telling and falling sometimes in non-essential detail or character comic, the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic value in the romanian society
2081	0	the good thing about this movie: the concept is interesting and there are some funny scene
2180	8	if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad
2193	2	good old hollywood style entertainment family value entertainment with just a hint of corn
2269	3	this terrorizer has a big cast of good actor (as an example:peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movie in the eighty
2312	4	the plot turn are nice and tight
2331	12	a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story
2351	13	i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable, and the cinematography went beyond sensational
2361	30	a definite must see movie
2375	3	i (somewhat) liked it
2386	0	as the jacket proclaims, this film is "gorgeously shot and masterfully edited," and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful.
2432	4	actually, considering that the approach to the theme from all these different director takes so many form, it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film.
2435	0	after some of the negative review i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had 3.99 in my wallet and thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie and saw this and gave it ago and i am glad i did, i enjoyed it.
2446	0	this is without a doubt one of the best movie i have ever seen
2479	1	the movie is from start to finish, an absolute gas
2497	5	the song that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new one are quite good one, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decor
2566	12	splendid performance and thirty flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel
2570	4	it is always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this does not quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but i really think that gene kelly and other who championed a place for dance in our life would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in japan, looking for something
2705	7	i think that if chester gould was still alive, he would be proud of warren beatty's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective
2706	1	while it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was superb.
2735	14	i think you will not regret it... maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think.
2744	0	surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock.
2809	8	what a truly remarkable movie
2930	14	this is new, and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movie which usually just repeat and reorder effect and feature that are already well-known, mostly since the silent time.
2968	23	do see it, and discover for yourself, if it has the funniest scene of all time in it
3081	7	so overall, i think it is one of the best animated fantasy movie ever made, and an awesome collaboration between two great mind - ralph bakshi and frank frazetta.
3118	4	i rate this, along with the simpson and the x-file, my three most favorite tv series.
3139		it is my favorite episode of smallville
3151	9	full of great hollywood location footage, both on the set, and off.
3167	5	i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have.
3265	6	beautifully shot, the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral character, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it is a winner.
3271	13	still, i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that i did not really mind these major flaw all too much.
3307	4	worth seeing
3369	9	in her short but memorable scene, she is the one who holds the essence of the story's moral
3394	3	a must see
3426	0	this movie is funny and suitable for any age.
3439	0	when i saw this animation for first time (i was 15 maybe) i was really impressed!
3454	0	beside the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actor deborah kara unger and matthew modine - where they really just acting?
3478	4	i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote.
3565	8	i gave the film a 7, but if i could rate just the acting, i would give the it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for streep
3579	0	this 1994 blockbuster had all of it good performance,music and direction
3612	4	rent it if you must, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
3651	14	watchable result for this offbeat western.
3658	11	the adaptation excel in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting: fedja van huet (egon) is one of the few dutch actor who can make you forget he is acting (which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve).
3720	10	one of the all time best ever
3723	9	the movie, however, was still pretty good
3730	0	it is one of the best movie i have seen in the last 2 year
3826	8	six degree is phenomenal, it is better than so many other tv programme out there!
3852	7	one of the greatest film of all time, from one of the greatest director, starring the greatest movie actor of all time, with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever, only warrant just above average?
3998	0	the larger-than-life figure of wyatt earp and bat masterson, and the specter of george armstrong custer and sitting bull, loom over director anthony mann's hugely entertaining first western with jame stewart.
4024	4	this is definitely a must see for person of all age.
4138	0	what an extraordinary crime thriller
4157	1	i was rather surprised at the end though.
4213	7	i would recommend this for a sunday morning.7/10
4244	1	it was intricate and well written and all the character where likable with out being horribly sweet
4330	14	final verdict: if you like thriller and film about serial killer and cop chasing killer, then you will like this.
4331	17	i would say this may be one of the best(..if not the best)example of the krimi genre, for it keeps you guessing, always one more ace up it is sleeve
4378	2	the movie has many objectionable scene and point of sexual politic and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foible of both sex, making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous point of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shot, some of them are bound to hit.
4394	0	cutting to the chase: this is one of the most amazing, most intense film i have seen in a long time.
4453	1	other than that, this movie is one of my favorite!
4572	2	they are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold.
4612	2	its screenplay and design are impeccable, not to mention the incredible cast.
4613	7	the way the sound mutes at vital point was a decision way ahead of its timethis is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audience, but one of my all time favourite, which is why i give this film a 10/10, in a word - beautiful
4626	0	i found the film quite expressive , the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain thing in life than person who mocked him
4705	5	this is probably the best of askey's movie.
4888	4	hearfelt thank to kay pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat
5039	19	all in all though it was an interesting set of story.
5101	0	if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that, "life" can never be the same, after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level.
5109	3	the animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effect, and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood
5129	4	a perfect piece of a major part of british and commonwealth history.
5131	3	lot of plot twist among the musical number
5187	0	an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effect of the crime and corruption of the santiago underworld on 2 naive young brother from the southern city of temuco
5196	21	but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.
5253	7	what separated this show from its contemporary and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scene.
5270	8	takes a while to get into, but then the time just disappear.
5281	5	many twist in this movie.
5317	7	i hope it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk - i will be first in line!
5320	12	there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15
5346	0	yes, the camera were in the right place at the right time.
5349	7	they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place.
5368	39	watch it first, then again and maybe again--it will grow on you before you realise it!
5408	12	this show has been a delight with many surprise.
5465	1	this movie is crazy hilarious, and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie.
5627	8	i know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on, and i thoroughly enjoyed it.
5804	3	what is amazing about his role is that it is a character it is hard to say we have seen before.
5857	10	however, it did receive several australian oscar and nominations.
5874	2	even if many person here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket, i got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.
5997	42	while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.
6061	4	despite the manipulation of time and space, the story is crystal clear, comprehensive and absorbing, a brilliant commentary on the "distortion" of everyday israeli life, where the political is intertwined with the personal, where everyone life "on the edge," and person never know whether they are playing leading role in their own life or are merely dispensable bit player in someone else's dramatic narrative
6190	14	it is strange , beautiful , poignant and clever but most of all it is a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 year .
6199	7	i will not say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining.
6204	0	this is my favorite show.
6245	8	i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarottus is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today!
6269	7	an entertaining diversion for fan of the mgm musical factory.
6526	4	i enjoyed all the character and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions
6527	8	i would recommand this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under-laying meaning of the movie and plot.
6607	1	it is definitely one of the top ten comedy made.
6687	9	the dvd is well-done with fine clear graphic (when they are supposed to be) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow.
6722	18	it offered a 'hip generation', humor that was not available in any other format/medium.
6900	1	that does not stop me from enjoying this film, it has a lot going for it.
6913	1	it has a deeper plot, better character development, and the tune (especially the closing song) are both catchy and warm-hearted.
6924	1	the script is sharp with plenty of great line, the acting is wonderful, the accent (i have been told) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful.
6955	0	this movie was amazing, it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movie by actor you look at other movie by director/ writer.
6997	17	it is one of those fun to watch movie.
7007	10	it is one of those classic movie moment that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography.
7025	2	they are fun, energetic, and very entertaining.
7039	10	the film is just so focused on powering forward that you can not help being swept along by it
7067	5	i felt the movie ended too abruptly, but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending
7141	0	i love the satan pit
7177	20	the race begins... this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road.
7198	4	despite these absurdity, the performance are all very good - especially those of paxinou and lorre.
7208	0	nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut's dark tale.
7235	10	all in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
7249	1	other then that, it is pretty good.
7333	0	better than the typical made-for-tv movie, invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting (urich, lucci, cassidy, mccarthy, pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto, soleil moon-frye) and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot.
7390	0	i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me.
7472	1	bad plot, bad sfx(60 million dollar budget), but the fighting scene were excellent
7504	16	still i recommend it.
7508	8	overall i think for majority of the gorehound on this board that you should just get your hand on a copy of this film for the novelty of it, but i suggest that for any new comer to these type of film that you should work your way up to this one.
7545	4	this is a great film from 1933 which was produced by darryl f. zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many year and just recently is being shown on the silver screen
7635	4	but let me just say, see it.
7638	16	never the less, i have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time.
7712	1	it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft-filmed/performed piece.
7750	0	i absolutely loved this movie!
7761	7	the film is a little slow to start, but it is never boring; and michael winner's screenplay provides a surprise that is almost impossible to guess from the offset, which certainly deserves some praise.
7805	15	all in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.
7821	8	the great thing about this game is that it actually has actor voicing the character, such as cleese voicing q
7847	0	the time is the future and for many not aware of it, that day is now.
7897	2	i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern twist.
7959	1	for me, that is what makes it so awesome!
8001	2	easily confused as the two film are so similar, but black hat is vastly the superior of the two..... yeah.
8017	3	the ending, however, still blows.
8020	25	fan of these film should give this one a look, and those that like the sci-fi creature feature might find some nice thing in here as well
8056	4	do not miss this one.
8068	3	this was one of the most poignant and funny movie of the year.
8119	3	all good exciting stuff - but i could not get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary.
8126	8	many fan also enjoyed character played by pastore, ventimiglia, curatola, proval, pantoliano, lip, sciorra and buscemi.
8135	1	very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades
8168	0	this show was a landmark in american comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all afro-american cast.
8177	1	while i knew it was only a "b" film, a space western, i loved it.
8217	3	it is certainly a must-see for hard-core fan of this genre, but other will probably have little reason to take interest
8226	13	but even so, this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fan of the genre
8566	5	if you get a chance to see it - go - you will not be disappointed.
8594	6	a heart breaker of a film that'll leave you wondering why at the end.highly recommended.
8613	24	still, it a one of a kind documentary--fascinating, funny and riveting
8631	9	there are more, see the movie to enjoy them.
8650	5	it is a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama.
8659	5	what makes this movie different from most slasher is that we are not in the victim's perspective, we follow feinstone because he is the main character.
8662	19	if you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away.
8666	3	the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance.
8682	4	generally would i only recommend it to fan of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv.
8726	2	i must have seen this film more time than any other, and i never tire of it.
8730	7	again, as long as person watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st, history 2nd i do not think a lot of harm will be done.
8761	1	writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny, foreboding and occasionally frightening!
8836	17	regardless, the magic generated by astaire and roger in their prime make this essential viewing.
8932	12	you barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural.
9031	0	i have seen this movie more than once.
9088	3	it moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice rukh's "house" and the movie start on a dark and rainy night) and karloff and lugosi (as always) give great performance.
9123	0	i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the 50's ("my" generation anyway).
9126	18	an excellent direction and script.
9130	9	lenser joseph h. august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black and white cinematography.
9143	1	yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it is nearly as light as a zombie are featured prominently among the character.
9144	10	this is certainly a movie that we will watch several time.
9255	0	i personally thought the movie was pretty good, very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame.
9358	4	yet i must admit, i cried like a lost little baby during this movie.
9364	1	fine casting, especially the choice of scott, who plays the role to the hilt..a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption.
9518	0	this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time.
9672	0	from start to finish, i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie.
9679	0	i read nothing but good thing about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more
9786	4	watch it, if you like quality cinema.
9853	0	errol flynn's greatest movie, not just a sport movie with a wonder last 5 minute where ward bond shine.
9885	4	i think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring.
9912	27	higher and higher' is nobody's idea of a 'great' musical, but it is an enjoyable delight, and i will rate it 8/10.
9989	14	for those looking for explosion and fancy special effect you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.
10129	3	all in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true murder, and you will want to read ann rule's book to get the accurate detail.
10159	5	it was was one of the best performance in the early cinema history and i think this movie would not be that nice if she was not in the leading role.
10274	7	full of light hearted joy, its impossible not to give this the highest score.
10328	0	please, future writer, producer, director - learn from this movie!never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen.
10349	7	close to leo is an excellent drama, which i strongly recommend
10364	8	all in all, i must say this movie is amazing, moving, and i highly recommend it.
10396	4	summing up: maintain interest all the way through, whether you are a sport fan or not.
10418	0	an excellent period murder melodrama, with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down.
10422	1	the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining.
10689	2	this was one of my favourite film as a kid.
10694	9	my vote is ten.
10920	0	this is one of my favorite movie of all time.
10969	28	this one was a good choice of mr. cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre
11016	1	the sundowner is a tightly-paced, gritty, and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by preston.
11125	2	but having said that, the boxing scene are a real eye-opener to the modern viewer.
11174	1	and each time i view it, i am more impressed by the story and the acting.
11215	1	barry jone and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting role in character that both have more to them than what meets the eye.
11243	2	recommended for all fan of the 70's tv movie much like trilogy of terror.
11244	0	anyone who loves the rheostatic' music is going to enjoy this film.
11327	0	excellent film showing the pathetic life of two nutty old lady.
11353	2	i was in fact very surprised, it was well worth watching; it was loosely scripted, almost like an ensemble piece of film.
11670	0	macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great mangeneral douglas macarthur.
11694	7	immensely moving, and as profound as camp ever gets.
11728	0	for those of you who have read rohinton mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation it is .
11857	15	rather than saddling him with low-budget potboiler, they should have put him to work on a few of those sword-and-sandal epic, picture that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally, where it is the poetic, operatic tonality that sweeps us along.
11942	3	i enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film.
11948	4	worth picking up just to see her
11983	2	i love this movie (i ordered the dvd from the us) and if the comment written by the kind of person who'd be happier with legally blond 3 do not put you off ~ give it a try
12049	4	the piece on how to decide on englebert's stage name will leave you in stitch!thank andrew and catherine!
12055	11	i recommend this movie, basically, to anyone that is a fan of movie.
12198	6	the cast is excellent, take a second on this film's home page to check it out
12208	21	i am sure, this movie looked great in the big screen.
12226	2	despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence, i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value.
12349	0	this movie was a brilliant concept.
12360	3	although considered documentary, and having won oscar in that category, this series of seven film is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scene of which capra recycle for his own purpose.
12520	3	the movie did not let me down.
12543	4	needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing
12555	7	all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares
12574	13	i was literally mesmerized with some of his scene that are raw, emotional and incendiary all at the same time
12582	7	the cast is terrific.
12631	0	although it is not as creepy as it is cult classic predecessor (zombi 2) i actually like this one better.
12653	0	watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memory .
12720	0	this has got to be the best movie i have ever seen
12897	0	it is a genuine shame that this spin-off tv series inspired by the superior made-for-tv picture "the night stalker" and "the night strangler" only lasted a single season and twenty episode, because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (carl kolchak's spirited verbal sparring match with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear), clever writing, nifty supernatural menace
13052	2	at least until now, and what an amazing movie this one is.
13054	1	i was not disappointed - he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance.
13146	1	arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performance, great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it.
13161	12	altogether a near wholly pleasurable if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy, the second best of them and well worth a watch for enthusiast of such thing.
13216	6	here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to person i know who like really gory movies
13219	18	delightful and very different.
13278	0	somewhat too long and going over the top toward the end, this comedy is an utterly delightful, never condescending or ridiculing look into the problem of a "power man", who likes to wear women´s clothe at nite.
13319	2	it is rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped.
13395	0	well, if you are one of those katana's film-nuts (just like me) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick
13416	0	this film is harmless escapist fun.
13542	6	but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for "monstervision."
13572	4	i highly enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it make sure you are in for a good laugh.
13598	2	the real merit of the picture is the cast.
13837	7	overall, it is a good family movie.
13847	9	overall, it is a must-see for history lover and anyone who wants to see a good film.
13925	17	"where the sidewalk ends" is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse character and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity.
13933	2	strauss is completely believable in his role, and pamela reed is, as always, wonderful.
13947	4	but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their life you can not help thinking what a superb director mende is road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performance .
13957	1	here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the head of the three protagonist as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfall.
13960	10	like i said before, it is refreshing.
13973	0	i love this show
14093	5	i have already watched it four more time, and cannot seem to get tired of it

14316	1	i love this movie from top to bottom.
14410	19	but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.

14524	9	my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator.

14970	17	will smith should have been nominated for a best actor award.
15058	10	i am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feeling stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty year later .
15091	4	i was also impressed with the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pan and tilt.
15111	2	what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personality and the irony of success and failure
15136	8	also the movie also has some major error like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break!this movie has some error but it is not a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movie then you better see demonicu
15215	22	so, despite looking like a nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting.
15236	2	the writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work, but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate.
15372	0	tho 35 year old, groove tube looks a lot like actual tv today
15413	0	this is a good movie, although person unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comic and book may find it a little slow and lacking in action.
15557	10	the film also has a brilliant soundtrack
15564	2	the character were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film, the character and the storyline for hour afterward.
15633	3	especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja film, you definitely have to see blood!
15671	3	a surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy
15821	2	even seeing a few second of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart.
15954	5	this documentary offers many exceptional picture that i have never seen before.
15959	9	i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general.
