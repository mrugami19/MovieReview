this is not an	-1.02	17	11

i kept waiting for	-1.02	29	2
the best of all	1.02	1	20
a few years later	1.02	14	35
it is not funny	-1.02	41	2

not at all bad	1.00	0	7
it just did not	-0.99	49	4
gets lost in the	-0.99	8	1
it is a total	-0.99	18	1
of the most interesting	0.99	4	24
it was a very	0.99	10	40
there is no story	-0.99	20	1
the only saving grace	-0.99	18	1
what will happen next	0.99	0	12
seems to be to	-0.99	7	1
i like this movie	0.98	3	14
do not bother with	-0.98	35	1
this could have been	-0.98	63	14
is at his best	0.98	0	14
plays the role of	0.98	3	19
the acting is terrible	-0.98	33	2
and as for the	-0.98	19	3
to look like a	-0.98	9	0
are not enough to	-0.98	18	1
be better than the	-0.98	13	2
would have been more	-0.98	37	9
this is a typical	-0.98	11	0
when it was first	0.98	6	29
i recommend it to	0.97	3	35
i did not enjoy	-0.97	28	6
unless you are a	-0.97	43	9
like a bunch of	-0.97	22	0
could have been so	-0.97	37	6
it is not an	0.97	5	29
the characters are well	0.97	0	20
give it a 4	-0.97	10	0
can not decide whether	-0.97	10	1
end of the show	-0.97	9	4
most of the cast	-0.97	24	5
and in doing so	0.97	1	12
what the hell was	-0.97	32	1
not one of them	-0.96	62	13
it is not enough	-0.96	23	3
of friday the 13th	-0.96	9	0
that is pretty much	-0.96	27	4
there are too many	-0.96	35	14
it is worth watching	0.96	8	26
go check it out	0.96	1	6
and do not really	-0.96	6	1
if you are really	-0.96	19	0
have to be so	-0.96	10	0
this made for tv	-0.96	16	7
i turned it off	-0.96	21	1
this is a very	0.96	45	122
i love this film	0.96	0	17
i felt sorry for	-0.96	12	2
one of my favourite	0.96	12	44
the people who lived	0.96	1	6
this film is awful	-0.96	15	1
one of the funniest	0.95	21	74
a lot of things	0.95	11	22
i recommend this to	0.95	5	18
by far the best	0.95	9	32
it is certainly a	0.95	3	12
i can not believe	-0.95	165	51
can not save the	-0.95	8	0
and the dialogue is	-0.95	14	5
well worth your time	0.95	0	15
the kennel murder case	0.95	0	10
more movies like this	0.95	1	14
what was the point	-0.95	31	0
on saturday night live	0.94	3	8
at the risk of	0.94	3	9
and you will have	-0.94	13	2
just does not have	-0.94	14	1
worst movie i have	-0.94	158	3
the whole thing is	-0.94	47	14
the movie as a	-0.94	23	13
that it is the	0.94	18	34
do not even bother	-0.94	26	2
save your time and	-0.94	17	1
that is about it	-0.94	61	10
that this would be	-0.94	12	1
the only redeeming feature	-0.94	13	0
not recommend this movie	-0.94	39	4
movie was pretty good	0.94	0	10
and a bunch of	-0.93	26	7
you have been warned	-0.93	32	4
recommend this movie to	0.93	28	64
it kept my attention	-0.93	6	0
the only reason to	-0.93	27	4
makes it difficult to	-0.93	7	3
was so bad i	-0.93	29	0
well it is a	-0.93	13	8
that would have been	-0.93	37	10
not in a good	-0.93	28	0
is not very good	-0.93	36	8
avoid like the plague	-0.93	15	0
the girl who played	-0.93	10	1
i was so disappointed	-0.93	15	1
does not try to	0.93	5	30
is probably the best	0.93	11	31
of all time this	-0.93	7	1
it is a movie	0.92	23	72
i do not even	-0.92	66	9
is not even worth	-0.92	32	0
the king of masks	0.92	0	10
the film is pretty	-0.92	10	6
in the whole movie	-0.92	29	5
this is not it	-0.92	19	3
this movie was excellent	0.92	0	11
could not save this	-0.92	18	0
have to sit through	-0.92	22	1
the last of the	0.92	5	17
and not in a	-0.92	34	2
today as it was	0.92	1	9
of all time the	0.92	9	29
but i think the	0.92	9	21
the strength of the	0.92	2	17
in a lot of	0.92	19	32
the idea that a	-0.92	11	3
i can not wait	0.92	8	63
the book the movie	-0.92	6	1
it over and over	0.91	11	29
i would definitely recommend	0.91	1	17
i loved it and	0.91	0	17
but there is something	0.91	1	18
not know if it	-0.91	22	6
you won't regret it	0.91	1	20
could have made a	-0.91	20	3
are better than this	-0.91	12	0
went straight to video	-0.91	8	1
on top of that	-0.91	50	19
should have known better	-0.91	17	0
gem of a film	0.91	0	16
looks like it was	-0.91	47	3
the acting was terrible	-0.91	28	2
the point of view	0.91	11	26
excuse for a movie	-0.91	28	0
a complete waste of	-0.91	50	2
it is just bad	-0.91	26	0
i am trying to	-0.91	30	9
it is about the	0.91	7	30
to watch the movie	-0.91	28	16
it is that bad	-0.90	24	1
is supposed to be	-0.90	298	65
then all of a	-0.90	12	1
is not for everyone	0.90	2	29
a very good job	0.90	7	31
panic in the streets	0.90	0	18
a very low budget	-0.90	11	2
is perfect as the	0.90	0	18
tries to be a	-0.90	19	4
it is an enjoyable	0.90	1	14
the performance of the	0.90	2	13
is a joy to	0.90	2	16
a much better movie	-0.90	17	1
the story of an	0.90	5	20
point of view but	-0.90	8	0
out of the blue	-0.90	22	2
it was a great	0.90	10	41
the story is pretty	-0.90	11	4
i really liked it	0.90	4	13
for no particular reason	-0.89	15	1
was looking forward to	-0.89	43	5
actor i have ever	-0.89	7	0
the movie has no	-0.89	17	0
just look at the	-0.89	16	5
i have nothing against	-0.89	13	2
any of the characters	-0.89	77	14
the story is so	-0.89	22	11
what is the point	-0.89	17	0
the makers of this	-0.89	46	10
it is an excellent	0.89	1	17
not waste your time	-0.89	218	7
put me to sleep	-0.89	15	1
the movie is well	0.89	1	9
is one of his	0.89	9	25
i simply could not	-0.89	10	0
this is not one	-0.89	43	11
minutes into the movie	-0.89	31	3
i first saw this	0.89	17	99
i enjoyed the first	-0.89	6	0
i believe this is	0.89	3	15
are looking for something	0.89	8	14
the first 15 minutes	-0.89	23	3
the only redeeming quality	-0.89	15	0
is a wonderful film	0.89	0	19
bad it is just	-0.89	11	2
in my opinion a	-0.89	12	8
that made it to	-0.88	5	0
did not get a	0.88	3	17
the special effects were	-0.88	47	13
movie is not worth	-0.88	18	0
at the time but	0.88	10	20
and that is saying	-0.88	27	7
the best movie ever	0.88	2	18
nothing to recommend it	-0.88	12	0
but not by much	-0.88	11	3
the impression that the	-0.88	18	4
not make up for	-0.88	16	1
down on his luck	0.88	2	20
i loved this show	0.88	0	7
i absolutely loved this	0.88	0	15
the first half but	-0.88	6	0
have never seen so	-0.88	7	1
if you are not	0.88	50	100
to capitalize on the	-0.88	14	3
the only good part	-0.88	13	1
it was an interesting	0.88	2	12
a really bad movie	-0.88	15	0
but i have seen	-0.88	21	5
it is not that	-0.88	75	27
the day to day	0.87	1	9
first part of the	0.87	10	19
to cash in on	-0.87	38	7
the cinematic equivalent of	-0.87	6	0
the film has a	0.87	24	53
the film was not	-0.87	19	5
this film has a	0.87	9	30
with this movie is	-0.87	29	6
this is a terrible	-0.87	18	2
some of the humor	0.87	1	12
i hope to see	0.87	1	17
it is also a	0.87	16	68
some of the episodes	0.87	0	7
to make up for	-0.87	41	9
twists and turns and	0.87	1	16
a young man who	0.87	5	17
time you watch it	0.86	0	7
it does not make	-0.86	33	5
is better than this	-0.86	15	1
as bad as it	-0.86	25	2
avoid it like the	-0.86	13	0
worst movie ever made	-0.86	37	0
and if you want	0.86	4	10
has none of the	-0.86	10	1
film to be a	0.86	4	11
if the movie was	-0.86	11	3
one of a kind	0.86	5	32
in one scene the	-0.86	10	2
it is an amazing	0.86	1	15
it is not hard	0.86	6	12
are we going to	-0.86	8	1
was a pretty good	0.86	3	18
there was not enough	-0.86	13	4
another one of those	-0.86	13	5
along the way they	0.86	1	9
the head of the	0.86	10	23
i have always liked	0.86	7	17
a bad bad movie	-0.86	7	0
you get the idea	-0.86	22	5
is not worth the	-0.85	22	2
really wanted to like	-0.85	37	2
comes up with a	0.85	2	12
was a big disappointment	-0.85	9	0

of the film to	-0.84	17	10
according to the dvd	-0.84	13	1

do not really know	-0.84	21	4
do not expect much	-0.84	16	2
this is my favorite	0.84	0	16
the total lack of	-0.84	10	0
i would not be	-0.84	32	12
though i am not	0.84	6	16
much of a plot	-0.84	11	1
in the first one	-0.84	18	4
this movie was terrible	-0.84	16	0
it is a rare	0.83	3	13
world war ii and	0.83	1	11
steals the show as	0.83	0	12
in the summer of	0.83	5	9
hour and a half	-0.83	116	34
i was waiting for	-0.83	25	2

it is not in	-0.83	11	3
my grade d dvd	-0.83	9	0
grade d dvd extras	-0.83	9	0

have seen a movie	-0.83	9	0
the film might have	-0.83	11	1
the acting was bad	-0.83	18	1
of the most important	0.83	5	19
nothing new to the	-0.83	8	0
that is why i	0.83	27	45
bad this film is	-0.83	13	1
that is all i	-0.83	21	8
you'd be better off	-0.83	6	1
a bit too long	0.83	1	13
there really is not	-0.83	30	4
is well written and	0.83	0	21
can not say i	-0.83	25	5
would have liked to	0.83	13	28
is a feel good	0.83	0	13
like watching paint dry	-0.83	11	0
does not mean you	-0.82	12	1
i have seen worse	-0.82	25	1
what it is a	0.82	5	23
in a world of	0.82	3	15
as bad as this	-0.82	22	0
problems with this movie	-0.82	14	0
so hard to be	-0.82	14	1
it is very good	0.82	0	9
it is so sad	-0.82	5	0
to be the worst	-0.82	38	3
from the first movie	-0.82	26	3
to write home about	-0.82	16	1
what's not to like	0.82	2	10
this film at all	-0.82	17	4
is in the same	0.82	5	12
i recommend this film	0.82	4	20
she is not a	0.82	3	11
i was looking forward	-0.82	36	4
would recommend this film	0.82	2	15
it just was not	-0.82	22	2
in this film was	-0.82	17	13
out of this world	0.82	5	17
if you can see	0.82	4	10
avoid this film like	-0.82	7	0
should have been more	0.82	5	15
this is a rare	0.82	2	7
who do not like	0.82	1	16
and above all the	0.82	2	8
to be taken seriously	-0.82	31	14
not too bad but	-0.82	16	1
in its depiction of	-0.82	6	2
return of the jedi	0.82	4	18
knew what they were	0.82	4	7
i do not get	-0.82	32	6
the last picture show	-0.82	7	3
we are left with	-0.82	32	13
quality of the film	-0.82	23	8
a 5 year old	-0.81	11	1
reason to watch this	-0.81	29	7
recommend this series to	0.81	0	6
not the worst of	-0.81	10	0
did an excellent job	0.81	2	21
not waste your money	-0.81	41	0
it is my favorite	0.81	1	9
if you want to	-0.81	296	124
is not the case	-0.81	20	11
that will make you	0.81	5	17
to pad out the	-0.81	11	1
very little to do	-0.81	9	2
as for the movie	-0.81	9	0
that is if you	-0.81	14	7
i did not pay	-0.81	26	4
is also very good	0.81	0	19
an attempt at a	-0.81	7	0
not even close to	-0.81	24	4
and worst of all	-0.81	21	3
no more than a	-0.81	13	4
is great and the	0.81	2	17
this is a highly	0.81	1	10
makes it clear that	0.81	2	8
as it should be	0.81	4	18
joseph gordon levitt and	0.81	0	5
the cat in the	-0.81	14	0
the characters are interesting	0.81	1	5
worth a look for	0.81	5	11
that most of the	-0.81	32	18
actors in this movie	-0.81	19	1
but it is certainly	0.81	5	14
it has a great	0.81	4	19
well worth checking out	0.81	0	10
wanted to like it	-0.81	7	0
it is just another	-0.81	18	4
just did not work	-0.81	28	2
much as i did	0.80	4	23
the acting is mediocre	-0.80	15	0
what appeared to be	-0.80	7	1
end of the story	0.80	3	11
film does not even	-0.80	8	2
for no good reason	-0.80	17	2
film also has a	0.80	0	9
in serious need of	-0.80	5	0
sit back and enjoy	0.80	2	20
if you watch the	0.80	5	11
at the height of	0.80	5	20
could not care less	-0.80	34	5
not a good sign	-0.80	10	1
this is a good	0.80	31	77
and in my opinion	0.80	4	26
in the us the	-0.80	4	1
a different type of	0.80	0	5
want to see an	-0.80	10	3
the man in the	0.80	8	34
is a great movie	0.80	4	94
will never get back	-0.80	39	1
in a way that	0.80	44	80
into the world of	0.80	5	26
there is a scene	-0.80	43	18
not much of a	-0.80	33	11
fast forward to the	-0.80	16	0
is a real treat	0.80	0	11
think that it is	0.80	8	22
lost in the translation	-0.80	5	1
know what the hell	-0.80	13	2
not bother with this	-0.80	29	0
you won't have to	-0.80	6	1
the first thirty minutes	-0.80	6	1
supposed to be a	-0.80	160	26
mess of a film	-0.80	13	2
of the movie for	-0.80	13	3
is not very interesting	-0.80	7	1
once in a lifetime	0.79	1	9
film it is a	0.79	22	40
a lot more of	0.79	2	7
definitely worth a look	0.79	1	15
i should have known	-0.79	18	0
waste of my time	-0.79	26	0
i give it 4	-0.79	5	1
based on a true	0.79	21	47
this is a fun	0.79	0	14
can not say that	0.79	15	15
in an american film	-0.79	5	0
to set up the	0.79	3	6
in front of them	-0.79	11	7
is great to see	0.79	4	26
this movie tries to	-0.79	11	0
there is nothing here	-0.79	12	2
what more do you	0.79	0	6
two and a half	-0.79	17	9
total waste of time	-0.79	31	1
i challenge anyone to	0.79	2	7
a great deal of	0.79	26	62
time and of course	0.79	0	6
it does not work	-0.79	27	8
what makes this film	0.79	5	27
to work with the	-0.79	13	1
it is just not	-0.79	38	16
go to the movies	0.79	3	13
the life of the	0.79	4	22
but it is very	0.79	8	29
and best of all	0.79	1	18
is not even a	-0.79	32	6
one hell of a	0.79	8	21
the film shows that	0.79	1	8
much worse than this	-0.79	7	0
say i did not	-0.79	23	3
for the murder of	0.79	2	14
it takes a little	0.79	0	5
are nothing short of	0.79	0	6
this film made me	0.79	3	7
but the script is	-0.79	14	3
i fell in love	0.78	0	24
as though she is	-0.78	6	1
could not they have	-0.78	9	0
my super ex girlfriend	0.78	1	7
also there is a	-0.78	10	4
she is supposed to	-0.78	19	1
the worst movie of	-0.78	20	0
which appears to be	-0.78	5	1
it is a story	0.78	10	31
the sentinel is a	0.78	1	9
and i was so	0.78	3	6
do yourself a favor	-0.78	70	17
is so bad that	-0.78	63	3
world it is a	0.78	0	5
postman always rings twice	0.78	0	17
the postman always rings	0.78	0	17
one of the producers	-0.78	6	1
he is one of	-0.78	29	31
was very well done	0.78	1	15
what i like about	0.78	0	16
why is not this	0.78	1	8
give it a 3	-0.78	11	0
i was very impressed	0.78	2	17
i have read that	-0.78	7	1
definitely a must see	0.78	1	15
is a very fine	0.78	0	6
is the only reason	-0.78	35	7
there are some great	0.78	6	23
should not be missed	0.78	0	14
stars out of 5	0.78	3	9
friday the 13th part	-0.78	7	0
this film is so	-0.78	40	10
and come up with	-0.78	5	1
but there is no	-0.78	40	14
and a half of	-0.78	46	6
time i see it	0.78	2	23
to be torn down	0.78	1	6
so much more than	0.78	2	16
that it is only	-0.78	8	5
this is actually a	0.77	6	9
would go on to	0.77	9	29
it is a beautiful	0.77	0	16
in the scene where	-0.77	12	7
has to deal with	0.77	5	15
at your own risk	-0.77	18	3
not want to watch	-0.77	10	3
the acting is superb	0.77	3	24
when it comes out	0.77	6	16
deserved an oscar for	0.77	1	5
should have been made	-0.77	9	0
plan 9 from outer	-0.77	28	5
9 from outer space	-0.77	28	5
is a great comedy	0.77	0	7
in the movie and	0.77	40	46
i liked this film	0.77	1	9
in the beginning of	0.77	17	24
is a beautiful and	0.77	3	9
this is not even	-0.77	21	1
would not recommend this	-0.77	48	3
a great way to	0.77	1	13
unfortunately this is one	-0.77	5	0
kind of like the	-0.77	10	3
all the way and	-0.77	5	4
idea of a good	-0.77	6	2
does not make it	-0.77	21	9
has going for it	-0.77	20	4
in the army and	-0.77	5	1
for a good movie	-0.77	14	0
the first film ever	0.77	0	5
is nothing but a	-0.77	22	4
in the first movie	-0.77	32	12
throughout the movie i	-0.77	14	4
it is all downhill	-0.77	14	0
you get the chance	0.77	4	29
it is a fun	0.77	7	30
in the film you	0.77	0	9
it is not perfect	0.77	1	15
ahead of its time	0.77	6	28
film is all about	0.77	1	10
does a superb job	0.77	0	13
of the characters i	-0.77	16	1
in this film it	-0.77	27	21
and i use the	-0.77	13	0
of the human spirit	0.77	1	13
into a world of	0.77	4	8
it other than the	-0.77	6	0
i have seen lately	0.77	0	9
go see this movie	0.77	13	19
wanted to love this	-0.77	5	0
that the characters are	-0.76	13	7
do not make sense	-0.76	19	4
2001 a space odyssey	0.76	3	15
do not see how	-0.76	27	11
like he is in	-0.76	9	0
to new york city	0.76	2	11
of the characters do	0.76	1	5
this is the second	-0.76	13	7
should have been the	-0.76	19	5
movie is a big	-0.76	6	0
people who made this	-0.76	22	1
that it has been	0.76	0	11
why did not he	-0.76	11	2
what was the purpose	-0.76	8	0
much as the next	-0.76	17	2
the events of the	0.76	10	18
might not be the	0.76	2	10
not a good film	-0.76	17	2
for the movie to	-0.76	14	2
i was pleased to	0.76	2	11
when it came out	0.76	23	49
of the few people	-0.76	9	0
how good it was	0.76	0	8
the same time this	-0.76	7	8
only complaint is that	0.76	0	17
i am so glad	0.76	12	23
of my favorite movies	0.76	1	40
is not bad but	-0.76	19	3
give it a 10/10	0.76	1	7
i am not against	-0.76	9	1
true to life and	0.76	0	6
is fast paced and	0.76	1	7
is not much better	-0.76	14	0
i will have to	0.76	9	16
highly recommend this film	0.76	1	27
nothing else to watch	-0.76	8	0
i think you will	0.76	3	28
where the sidewalk ends	0.76	0	14
the ending of this	-0.76	12	2
there is just not	-0.76	6	1
this movie was so	-0.76	50	6
that one of his	0.76	1	4
it is an old	-0.76	6	2
is not a very	-0.76	22	7
the movie is great	0.76	3	11
from one scene to	-0.76	13	2
i cannot say that	-0.75	6	1
i also love the	0.75	0	14
are going to love	0.75	2	9
never be the same	0.75	1	10
that the film does	0.75	2	14
not one but two	-0.75	11	2
not enough to save	-0.75	17	1
a little slow but	0.75	0	10
may as well have	-0.75	11	0
my favourite scene is	0.75	0	6
have not seen it	0.75	22	78
there must be a	-0.75	7	3
he does not look	-0.75	9	4
throughout the entire movie	0.75	8	10
the singing and dancing	0.75	0	7
do not give a	-0.75	13	2
it is definitely a	0.75	1	18
this film do not	-0.75	21	4
worst of all it	-0.75	8	0
the worst thing about	-0.75	19	4
the film is very	0.75	16	42
of life and death	0.75	2	14
if there are any	-0.75	6	2
can not wait to	0.75	12	58
stars of the day	0.75	1	7
to see more of	0.75	11	34
because it was the	-0.75	10	3
and not just a	-0.75	6	0
the story is bad	-0.75	7	0
this show has been	0.75	0	5
this movie is terrible	-0.75	15	1
you will enjoy the	0.75	4	12
maybe it is a	-0.75	7	4
and does not let	0.75	0	11
making a movie about	-0.75	13	2
get their hands on	-0.75	4	2
on the hunt for	-0.75	6	0
at least once a	0.75	0	14
that is not enough	-0.75	18	4
also in the cast	-0.75	9	7
the characters are great	0.75	0	10
which by the way	-0.75	19	4
i am not even	-0.75	48	13
do not think any	-0.75	12	2
do not think there	0.75	9	16
in the u s	0.75	16	38
give it a 7	0.75	3	17
of the actors and	0.75	9	17
well worth a watch	0.75	1	8
the people who made	-0.75	30	5
have to listen to	-0.75	10	2
in the first place	-0.75	153	61
black and white it	0.75	0	9
this film takes you	0.75	0	6
the title of this	-0.75	15	7
gandhi my father is	0.75	0	6
to make it look	-0.75	22	5
meant to be a	-0.75	41	22
what it is worth	-0.75	16	7
him in the end	0.75	3	8
part of this film	-0.75	21	9
and i think they	0.75	2	9
but when it comes	-0.75	9	4
comes out on dvd	0.75	3	15
as long as it	-0.75	25	9
not just for the	0.75	2	9
this film is just	-0.75	25	10
not worth the time	-0.75	15	0
movie is a great	0.75	5	20
though i do not	0.75	10	23
best things in the	-0.74	3	3
end up with a	-0.74	9	1
are introduced to a	-0.74	8	3
is well worth watching	0.74	0	14
there is little to	-0.74	15	2
but i liked it	0.74	2	7
think that the movie	0.74	1	9
it was a good	0.74	20	34
have to remember that	0.74	2	8
is just as good	0.74	0	17
could come up with	-0.74	20	3
what must have been	0.74	5	7
it is in the	0.74	12	24
of the jokes were	-0.74	6	1
sat in the theater	-0.74	5	0
rent it buy it	0.74	0	6
is plenty of gore	-0.74	6	0
this is a lovely	0.74	0	6
i just love it	0.74	0	7
so that he can	-0.74	18	12
of the worst movies	-0.74	156	2
it does not quite	0.74	3	11
that in order to	-0.74	11	4
caused the death of	0.74	0	6
do not watch the	-0.74	12	3
a man in his	0.74	0	8
